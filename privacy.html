  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 11 January 2026</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile applications
  <strong>Burraco Score (All versions)</strong>, <strong>Libor (All versions)</strong>, <strong>Leasing calculator (All versions)</strong>, <strong>Mortgage Calculators (All versions)</strong>, <strong>Guess that State (All versions)</strong>, <strong>Codice di Gara (All versions)</strong>, <strong>Indovina la regione (All versions)</strong> and
  <strong>Euribor (All versions)</strong> (collectively, “the Apps”) collect, use and protect
  information when you use them.</p>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <p>The Apps may collect the following types of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic device information (model, operating system version, language, country, anonymous identifiers) for analytics and crash reporting.</li>
    <li>Usage data about how you interact with the Apps (screens viewed, buttons tapped, session duration).</li>
    <li>Approximate location, only when required by third‑party advertising networks to deliver relevant ads.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Apps do not intentionally collect information that directly identifies you such as your name, email address or phone number, unless you voluntarily contact us by email and provide such data.</p>

  <h2>How we use the information</h2>
  <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Operate and improve the Apps and their features.</li>
    <li>Monitor performance, fix bugs and ensure technical stability.</li>
    <li>Show non‑personalised advertising and measure its performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
  <p>The Apps may use third‑party services such as analytics and advertising SDKs (for example, Google Mobile Ads, Flurry Analytics or similar services). These providers may collect and process data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>
  <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these providers to understand how they handle your data.</p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain usage and analytics data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described above, and as required by applicable law. After that, data is deleted or anonymised.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <p>You can control certain types of data collection by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the privacy settings of your device (for example, resetting the advertising identifier or limiting ad tracking).</li>
    <li>Adjusting in‑app settings where available (for example, disabling analytics or personalised ads).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The Apps are not directed to children under the age required by applicable law (for example, 13 in the United States, 16 in the European Union). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect the data processed by the Apps against unauthorised access, loss or misuse. However, no system can be completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be published on this page with an updated “Effective date”. We recommend that you review this page periodically.</p>
